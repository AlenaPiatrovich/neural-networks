# Neural networks
Repo for master degree course "Neural networks" (BSU, FAMSC, Algorithms and Big Data Systems).
This repo consists of 2 projects. 

The first one is classification of handwritten characters (Extended MNIST). Classifier in this project is ResNet with 4 stacked layers.

The second is classification of chest x-rays (normal/with pneumonia). Neural network from the second project consists of pretrained MobilNetV3 and several "new" layers.
